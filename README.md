# readSensorData
Small script to read temperature sensor data from stdin and to push it to influxdb

Input comes from multiple sensors via stdin.

The output is then displayed in grafana.

## Scripts
`generateDummyValues.py`: Generate testdata and write it to stdout

`readSensorData.py`: Read the data from stdin and write it to influxdb
